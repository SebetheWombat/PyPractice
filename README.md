# PyPractice
The goal here is to ramp up my Python skills by solving challenges collected from various sources(books, forums, etc.). Feel free to explore any and all solutions to work on your own or suggest improvements.

**find_first_even**: The challenge here is to write a function that accepts a list of integers and returns the first even number in that list. If no even number is found, raise an exception and inform the user. Source:*Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python ~John V. Guttag*

**sum_of_nums**: Write a function that takes in a string and adds up the decimal digits in that string if any. Use try/except statement. Source:*Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python ~John V. Guttag*
